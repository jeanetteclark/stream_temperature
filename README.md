# Stream Temperature Inventory
Stream temperature is an important parameter to ecology, climate, and hydrology studies in Alaska. Stream temperature datasets have been archived as part of a project to collect a comprehensive statewide inventory of current and historic continuous monitoring locations for stream and lake temperatures throughout Alaska. The inventory is an effort between the [State of Alaskan Salmon and People (SASAP)](https://alaskasalmonandpeople.org/) and the [Alaska Center for Conservation Science's Alaska Online Aquatic Temperature Site (AKOATS)](http://accs.uaa.alaska.edu/aquatic-ecology/akoats/) to make stream temperature data more readily available for researchers. 

Stream temperature data have been collected by various entities, including the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks between 2004 and 2017. Many of the stream temperature monitoring sites are ongoing; however, some sites are missing data or have been discontinued. Each archived package includes stream temperature data files and a site level metadata file.
